# Step 1
* Install node (link)
* add basic package.json file
* install node modules bower and grunt via ```npm install --save-dev bower grunt``` (we want --save-dev here as the node_modules usually are just helpers and are not needed as deployed files)

#Step 2
* add bower.json (link)
* ```bower install -S bootstra-sass```
